# What is all about

We have two containers on with cassandra and other with golang.

Point is that golang writes in cassandra DB and then retrieves all data from Cassandra DB.


## Cassandra DB

This uses basic image from docker hub (https://hub.docker.com/_/cassandra/) - we used 3.11 version

## Golang container
